# Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains 3 school mini-projects, as an implementation of algorithms seen in class to solve Reinforcement Learning problems:
* Dynamic Programming: "Value Iteration" & "Policy Iteration" on Basic Grid World example.
* Monte Carlo Methods: Implementation of "Every Visit Monte Carlo" algorithm to evaluate a fixed policy and "On-policy Monte Carlo" algorithm to find an optimal policy to solve [Blackjack](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/blackjack/) and [Frozen Lake](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) problems using [Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) library environments.
* Temporal Difference Learning: Implementation of SARSA & Q_learning algorithms to solve [Frozen Lake](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/), which is an uncertain environment, as the agent is walking on a frozen lake and the thickness of the ice varies.
